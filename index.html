                <p><i>(Student at Madhav Institute os Tecnology & Science)</i></p>
                
                <p>I am an Btech undergrad in the computer science & engineering at Madhav institute of technology & science and also pursuing Minor Degree with Research in Science & Technology.</p>
                
                <p><b>Research Interests:</b> My research interests lie at the intersection of Deep Learning, AI engineering, Robust Algorithms, and Cyber-Physical Systems. I am specifically interested in developing reliable, real-world AI applications that address challenges in Digital Healthcare and Financial Security. My work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical machine learning and scalable deployment, ensuring that intelligent systems are both architecturally sound and practically viable for edge devices and mobile platforms.</p>
